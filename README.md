## What is Jenkins ?

Jenkins is a self-contained, open source automation server which can be used to automate all sorts of tasks related to `building`, `testing`, and `delivering` or `deploying` software.

Jenkins can be installed through native `system packages`, `Docker`, or even run `standalone` by any machine with a Java Runtime Environment (JRE) installed.

Originally developed for continuous integration (CI), today Jenkins orchestrates the entire software delivery pipeline â€“ Continuos Integration / Continuos Delivery (CI/CD).
